This database is made for an international airport.
It keeps information about airports, flights, airlines, passengers, bookings, boarding passes, baggage, and checks.
The design uses Third Normal Form (3NF).
This means every table has only one topic, no repetition, and no indirect dependency.
The relationships show how tables are connected. For example, one flight can have many bookings, and one booking can have many baggage.
With this design, the data is clean, easy to update, and clear to understand.
